# This is a Challange  for php5.4 servers and my Internship challange

###  Apache2 
** Firstly who have to know you can't work with apache2.4.* version that way you have to install apache2.2 version but anyway  you will see a problem on there cause phpmyadmin and database aren't supported anymore in local machines for php5.4.45 that cause you have to upgrade your version minumum 5.5 or newer version**

### Php5.6  
 **  There are not many differences but  critical like  database connection. If you are using php 5.4.45, 5.5 or 5.6 you have to use " mysqli_connection()" for database connection and queries must be this  mysqli_connection() format rules.**

 ### Debian 9.5 

 ** if you are a user of Debian  do not think that's will be simple cause normaly Debian7.5 wheezy version automaticly installing defaul php5.4.45 version but  same way  there isn't any database supporting for localmachines please attention for localmachines !!! That cause anyway you have to upgrade your version.** 
  
   ** One more thing please don't forget to import database  to your local database **
